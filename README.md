# Photobucket hotlink fix

Extension to fix the hotlinking issue in Photobucket, It's not needed to pay anything with this extension, all the images will continue loading without any p500 image. If it's not working for you, clear cache or do a full refresh of the page.

The extension doesn't access to your data on the websites, neither to the users nor passwords. It needs the permissions to access the urls to detect photobucket links and fix the request to keep the images working as before.
